# Protohackers Challenges

This repository contains a collection of Python solutions to problems found on Protohackers.com.

From the site:
> Protohackers challenges you to create servers for network protocols.
>
> We give you the protocol spec. You write the server and host it. We automatically test it.
>
> There's a global leaderboard for the fastest solve times and a new problem every ~2 weeks.

## Challenges

Each solution is implemented as a separate directory named after the challenge (e.g. `0-smoke-test/`). 

Applications are written as Python modules, packaged with Docker, and deployed using Fly.io.
